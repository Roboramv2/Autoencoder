# Image Compression and Decompression using Convolutional Autoencoders and K-means Clustering

A project which performs compression and decompression of images from the MNIST dataset. 


### Environment

 - Coded in python 3.8
 - Interactive python notebook editor - Google collab


### Installation
To run the flask app in a  windows environment

 1. Install python 3.8
 2. Run ```pip install virtualenv```
 3. Run ```mkdir project``` to create project directory
 4. Run ```cd project``` to move to the project directory
 5. Run ```virtualenv venv``` to create a virtual environment
 6. Run ```.\Scripts\activate```  to activate the virtual environement
 7. Run ```pip install tensorflow numpy Flask keras matplotlib pillow opencv-python scikit-image``` to install the dependencies
 8. Copy the contents of the Flask app folder to your virtual environment and use command ```python app.py``` to run the app. 

The python notebooks can be executed in Google collab by signing up for a Google account. 
Upload the pre-trained models into the collab runtime and load them to execute the code faster.
